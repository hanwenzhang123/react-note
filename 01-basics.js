//ReactDOM.render()
//The 'react-dom' library provides DOM-specific methods. The one you'll use the most is ReactDOM.render(), which renders React elements to the DOM.

// render the react element to the DOM
//  accept 2 arguments
//  react/js element describe the element you want to render element
//  actually element you want to update or where render to

 ReactDOM.render(    //this is what create and update the DOM, and it manages the root element
    header,     //the header element
    document.getElementById('root')     //DOM element with DI root, container element
 ); //the code will be rendered to <div id='root'></div> in html
//it is render's job to interprete the element object and create DOM out of them
