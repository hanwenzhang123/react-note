//Unidirectional Data Flow
In React, data naturally flows down the component tree, from the app's top-level component down to the child components, via props. 

This is called "unidirectional data flow".

In our app, application state lives in the main app component and all of its child components can be given access to it.


//Lifting state up
In react, two or more components can share the same state
When two or more components need access to the same state, we move the state into their common parent. 
Moving state to our application parent component and communicating the data downwards through props.

This is called "lifting state up".

In our app, we put players object in the parent file to pass down to the children components that they can access to, which lifting state up 


//Communicating Between Components
using props to communicate with parent like a callback function to the parent

Instead of passing state to a child component the parent can pass down a callback function
The callback will allow you to communicate events and changes in your data upwards, while data continues to flow downwards.


//Update State Based on a Player's Index
finish writing the handleScoreChange function by updating state based on the index of a player object.
