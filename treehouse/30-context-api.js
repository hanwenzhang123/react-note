//What is Context API
React provides a way to pass data to components without having to pass props manually at every single level, or reach for a state management library like Redux.

In the typical React data flow, components communicate with each other via props.
For example, a parent component can pass data from state down to child components through props.

<Main grandies={this.state.grandchildren}>    //you can pass it down
    <Parent>
      <Child>
        <GrandChild1 />
        <GrandChild2 />
        <GrandChild3 />
      </Child>
    </Parent>
</Main>

However, what if there are grandchild of the grandchild of the grandchild.

prop drilling
--the cascade of props that gets data to parts of the react component tree.


//How Context Works
Context is mainly used when certain data needs to be accessed by many components at different nesting levels.
The communication between the Provider and Consumers is what makes context works.

Context API 3 steps
- createContext()
- Provide
- Consumer

1. React.createContext()
  - sets up a context and returns an object with a provider and a consumer, the two main components of the context API.
2. Provider
 - Used as high as possible in the component tree, it allows a consumer to subscribe to context changes. 
3. Consumer
 - Access the provider to get the data it needs, the consumer is what helps avoid prop drilling.
