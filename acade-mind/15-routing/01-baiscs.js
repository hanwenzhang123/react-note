Single Page Application Routing
Multiple pages in single page app
- what is client side routing
- using react router
- advanced features: dynamic and nested routes

//What is Routing? Why?
URL changes, visible content changes
//Traditional Multi-page Routing
HTML is requested & loaded
Page change = new request + response
//Building Single Page application
when building complex user interfaces, we typically build Single Page Application (SPAs)
Only one initial HTML request & response
Page (URL) changes are then handled by client-side (React) code -> changes the visible content without fetching a new HTML file

// React Router 
  - npm install react-router-dom
