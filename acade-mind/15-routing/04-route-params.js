//Extracting Route Params
//pages/ProductDetail.js
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';   //import the custom hook "useParams"

const ProductDetail = () => {
  const params = useParams();  //call it and store it to the params

  console.log(params.productId);  //We used ":productId" as the key for the dynamic path segment, so it will prints out the value in URL

  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Product Detail</h1>
      <p>{params.productId}</p>
    </section>
  );
};

export default ProductDetail;
