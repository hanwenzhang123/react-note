//Working with Nested Routes
You are not limited to defining routes in one place only, you can define routes wherever you want.
And if they are on a component which is currently active, they will be evaluated by React Router DOM.

//pages/Welcome.js
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';   //we can again import and define the Route wherever you want 

const Welcome = () => {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>The Welcome Page</h1>
      <Route path="/welcome/new-user">   // we are on /welcome, hence this component is loaded, we define another route for /new-user after /welcome
        <p>Welcome, new user!</p>   //can not be path="/products" because we can never be on that welcome page for a path that starts with slash products.
      </Route>
    </section>
  );
};

export default Welcome;
