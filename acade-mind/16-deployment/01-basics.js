Deploying React App
From development to production
- Deployment steps and pitfalls
- server-side routing vs client-side routing

Deployment Steps
- Test code
- Optimize code
- Build app for production
- Upload production code to server
- Configure server

Optimization
- useMemo()

//Build the code for production
npm run build 
- build production output
- once you run npm run build, we have a build folder
- the content of the build folder holds all you need to deploy to the server at the end

//Getting Started with Deployment (uploading files)
A react SPA is a "Static Website"
- only HTML, CSS & JavaScript
