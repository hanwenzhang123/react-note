useReducer() for State Management
sometimes, you have more complex state - for example if it got multiple states, multiple ways of changing it or dependencies to other states
useState() then often becomes hard or error-prone to use - it is easy to write bad, inefficient or buggy code in such scenarios
useReducer() can be used as a replace for useState() if you need more powerful state management
