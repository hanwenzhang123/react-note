Component-Drivern User Interfaces
- building interactive & scalable UIs

React is a JavaScfript library for building user interfaces
React makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler
React is all about "Components"
- because all user interfaces in the end are made up of components

What is a "Component"?
reusable building blocks in your user interface
components are a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
You build these individual components and then you tell React how to compose them together into a final user interface.

Why Components?
- reusability (do not repeat yourself)
- separation of concerns (do not do too many things in one and the same place (function))
split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions

How is a component built?
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
All React components are building a combination of all above, mainly HTML and JS

React allows you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML and JS (and CSS)
Declaretive Approach - using a specific way
Defind the desired target state(s) and let Reaact figure out the actual JS DOM instructions
