1. What does this code snippet do?
someArray.map((element) => <p>{element}</p>)
It transforms an array (someArray) into a new array full of JSX elements (which can be output by React)

2. Why should you add the special "key" prop to list JSX elements?
It is required for React to correctly identify and update (if needed) the list elements
It's a unique identification criteria for every element.

3. What's true about outputting conditional content in React components?
You can work with regular ternary expression of it checks to output or return different results in/from your component
