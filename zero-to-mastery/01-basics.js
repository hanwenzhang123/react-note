//breaking into components
state is always something that changes because user interaction
state usually lives in one location or a specific state only one location, it trickles down as props
one way data flow, data pass down through props

if a state changes, it is going to happen through setState
it will anounce passing down to re-render
each component is a function that renders
if state changes, it is going to notify its component run the render function again
